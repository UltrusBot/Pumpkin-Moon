Pumpkin Moon
------------

This mod is planning on recreating the pumpkin moon event from Terraria, and was made for SpookyJam 2023

Currently, it adds the Pumpkin Moon Medallion, which can be found in chests in small dungeons, that when used summons a swarm of enemies like the Headless Horseman, which ride their haunted horses, which you can claim by slaying them, and the Splinterlings, zombie-like creatures which drop spooky wood when they die.

#### Plans

*   Add the The Horseman's Blade
*   Add the Mourning Wood and the Pumpking minibosses.
*   Add the witches broom.
*   Multiloader-ify this, so it has Forge+Fabric version
